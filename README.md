# NFC-Based-Keyless-Entry
This project implements a keyless vehicle entry system using ESP32, PN532 NFC Module, and a servo motor/relay. The system allows authorized NFC tags or smartphones to unlock the vehicle without a physical key.

# Features
-Secure Access – Unlocks only with authorized NFC tags.

-Supports Servo & Relay – Can control a servo motor (for latch mechanism) or a relay (for electronic locks).

-ESP32 Controlled – Handles NFC authentication and controls locking mechanism.

-I2C Communication – Uses I2C protocol for PN532 NFC module.

# Future Enhancements

-Mobile App Integration – Use Bluetooth/Wi-Fi for remote unlocking.

-Multiple Users – Store multiple NFC tags for multiple users.

-Security Features – Implement encryption/authentication for added security.
